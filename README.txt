WP Engine has a custom 404 page for bots. This plugin removes that customization.

== Description ==

To help conserve resources (and because bots don't care), WP Engine has a custom 404 page for bots. This plugin removes that customization, which allows themes and plugins to serve their own 404 instead.

== Installation ==

Simple installation:

1. Upload the `remove-wpengine-404` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress

Advanced installation (`mu-plugins` directory):

1. Upload *just* the `remove-wpengine-404.php` file to your `/wp-content/mu-plugins/` directory
2. That's it... the plugin is already activated! Take a look under Plugins > Must Use
